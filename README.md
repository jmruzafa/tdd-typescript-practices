## About Test Driven Development

TDD is not a testing tool but a **software design tool** that will help us to build solid applications. The basics of TDD can be summarised as follow and this flow is known as "red, green, refactor". There are 3 steps:

1. Write a failing (red) test
1. Make the test pass (green)
1. Refactor your code as needed to keep it clean while keeping the tests passing

To "test drive" this kata, just start for the simplest case and wait that your solution won't run, then fix it until it passes the test and refactor it as soon as you feel the code is duplicated or becomes a mess.

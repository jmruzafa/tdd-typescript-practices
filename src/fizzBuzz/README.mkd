## Fizz Buzz Program

This kata, taken from a popular children's maths game (or student drinking game), is the starting point on the TDD track. It's designed to be a semi-guided first stop for learning TDD from scratch.

We'll emphasise the following:

* Start by writing a failing test for the simplest behaviour.
* Implement the simplest amount of code needed to make the test pass.
* As you add more tests, refactor to make the code more generic and more suitable.

Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

* If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
* If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
* If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string "FizzBuzz". 
* Otherwise it will return the same number given as input

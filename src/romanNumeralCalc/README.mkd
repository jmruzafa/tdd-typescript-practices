## Roman Numeral Calculator

This kata is meant to be a calculator that is able to return roman numerals. You can put the limit. I would start just calculating till 100 or below and then upgrade to the next limit.
Some basics of the roman numerals. They have some base *numbers* (just to call so) that can be joint following some formulas to get others. There is no 0 in such list!
